Talk about udp communication using udp in c and python2
1. On RPI use netcat with python udp_send local, 127.0.0.1. nc -kluv 127.0.0.1 5005
Talk about why netcat can't receive multiple messages.
It locks onto its source. So if we made a loop it would send multiple
show for loop
2. python udp_receive <= udp_send talk about binding ports
3. Move to C
4. udp-sender.c -> nc -lu 127.0.0.1 5005
5. udp-sender.c -> udp-receiver.c , do make clean the make on receiver
6. run python send on computer and udp-receiver on rpi. do ifconfig to see ip addr
7. Explain how it works both ways
8. Move to the structs branch and explain packed types with aligment
9. run udp-sender->udp-receiver
