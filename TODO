frequency at which the elbow moves
on/off battery test for tapping and conducting ie moving the arms


about 120 minutes of battery life from tapping. Got 30% battery drop in 42 minutes.

using 2 arm motion, drains at about 1% per minute... dropped 95% to 83% in 14 minutes.

getting the latency of the commands -- todo with video

see if tapping can be at 1.2Hz.. Yes!

2.5 Hz 5% 2.8 minutes so 2% per minute so about 30 minutes of use. 


CV for experiment!
